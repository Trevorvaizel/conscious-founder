# Product Requirements Document - conscious-founder

**Author:** Rabbit
**Date:** 2026-01-08

## Executive Summary

The Conscious-Founder Module bridges intuition-driven discovery with structured content creation by wrapping the existing K2M Attention Control Mode and 4-agent architecture into a BMAD-native module with structured injection points and return protocols. Unlike typical AI writing tools that turn humans into reviewers, this system preserves the "boiling phase" where intuition compounds—adding structure at the right moments (before workflow execution and after publishing) while respecting non-linear, memory-based creative processes.

The module converts standalone agent documents into invoke-able BMAD agents, adds a pre-workflow "inject" workflow to capture emphasis/angle before K2M runs, a post-publish "return" workflow for re-entering knowledge nodes and deepening insights, and a "repurpose" workflow to extract social posts from published newsletters.

### What Makes This Special

The critical design principle: **"The tool accelerates execution but must never replace the boiling phase where intuition does what AI can't: compound connections across time in your own cognitive architecture."** The module adds structure AROUND the creative process, not attempts to replace the intuitive compounding phase. Unlike systems that make humans reviewers of AI-generated content, this maintains human judgment at critical checkpoints while preserving the non-linear "node-orbiting" pattern where insights compound across NotebookLM sessions over time.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** developer_tool (BMAD module/SDK)
**Domain:** general (creative tooling)
**Complexity:** low
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**Atelier Model with Creative Cartography:**
- Module operates on atelier model: Rabbit is master, agents are skilled collaborators who provide craft expertise while respecting creative vision
- Zero friction between "idea in head" → "idea captured" → "agents collaborating" — flow state preserved and extended throughout creative session
- Agents feel like creative partners who amplify (not replace) creative voice — "Yes, and" collaboration where agents build on ideas
- Conversational interfaces match natural thinking and speaking patterns — no context switching penalties
- Creative confidence INCREASES with each session through agent collaboration and cartographic insights

**Dual Mode Flexibility:**
- **Structured Mode:** Clear phases (Inject → Transform → Return → Repurpose) with territory mapping after each publication
- **Freeform Mode:** Conversational exploration where agents jump in organically based on creative need
- User chooses mode based on creative state — structured when executing, freeform when exploring

**Workflow-Specific Success:**
- **Inject Workflow:** Capture creative emphasis/angle in < 30 seconds without breaking flow state — plant seed before boiling phase completes
- **Transform Workflow:** Execute full K2M pipeline with 50%+ time savings and zero behavioral drift from standalone agent execution
- **Return Workflow:** Re-enter any published node within 60 seconds with full context preserved for deepening and cross-pollination
- **Repurpose Workflow:** Generate 3-5 ready-to-post social posts from published newsletter in < 5 minutes using ACM framework

**Altitude Perspective (Creative Cartography):**
- Agents provide "10,000-foot view" of creative landscape — patterns and connections visible only from altitude
- Discover thematic connections across months/years of work: "You've explored X from 12 angles — here's the evolution map"
- Identify recurring paradoxes/tensions: "This pattern appears in 8 pieces — never named but clearly core"
- Recognize intuitive frameworks: "You've invented a framework instinctively — want to formalize it?"
- Navigate creative landscape as territory (not just individual pieces) through conversational cartography

**The Altitude Moment:**
When agents provide territory report, user experiences realization: "I had NO IDEA I was exploring that territory" — seeing own creative evolution and patterns that surprise

### Business Success

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Time Savings:** 50%+ reduction in K2M execution time through structured BMAD workflow vs manual agent invocation
- **Insight Capture:** 80%+ reduction in lost "aha!" moments during boiling phase through Inject workflow capturing emphasis before completion
- **Node Re-engagement:** Increase return-to-node rate from "rarely" to "weekly" through structured Return workflow with full context
- **Content Output:** 3-5 social posts per newsletter generated in < 5 minutes using Repurpose workflow with ACM quality

**Territory Discovery Rate:**
- Number of NEW insights emerging from agent cartography that wouldn't have emerged otherwise
- Number of inter-node connections discovered per session (thematic, paradoxical, framework-level)
- Time saved through altitude perspective: "I would have needed 6 months of boiling to see this pattern"
- Breadth of territory visible: One report shows connections across 18+ months of work

**Qualitative Success:**
- After using module, user feels like THEIR system amplified (not replaced by generic tool)
- Module feels like "extending cognition" not "using software"
- Creative partnerships feel energizing (not draining)
- User can see patterns in own thinking that surprise them

### Framework Essence Preservation

**Zero Semantic Loss Conversion:**
- All 11 source documents converted to BMAD format with zero semantic loss — every nuance, tone instruction, and execution warning preserved
- Agent persona, communication style, and principles preserved verbatim from source documents
- Complete ACM framework preserved: all 7 modules, 3 non-negotiables, litmus test, 5 juggling patterns with psychological descriptions
- Checkpoint philosophy preserved: "YOUR insights + My pattern recognition + Your judgment + My execution = YOUR voice at scale"
- Workflow sequence matches Rabbit's actual creative rhythm (not cleaned up/optimized version)
- Boiling phase respected as sacred space — module adds structure AROUND creative process, never attempts to replace intuitive compounding

**Knowledge Base Architecture:**
- Single-source-of-truth for shared frameworks: ACM modules, juggling patterns, voice constants, quality gates
- Each agent references knowledge base at runtime (prevents divergence when frameworks updated)
- Updates to framework propagate to all agents automatically
- Cartographic principles and pattern recognition added as knowledge base items

**Essence Verification Tests:**
- Side-by-side comparison: source document output vs BMAD agent output must be byte-for-byte equivalent in prompt content
- Rabbit qualitative review: "Does this feel like my system?"
- Framework compliance check: All ACM modules present and correct with proper tone calibration

### Technical Success

**Agent Wrapping:**
- Zero behavioral drift in wrapped K2M agents — Analyst/Architect/Copywriter/Editor produce identical output through BMAD invocation vs standalone
- Agent invocation time: < 2 seconds from command to agent response
- Zero state loss between workflows — Inject context flows into Transform seamlessly
- All workflows independently testable with clear inputs/outputs
- 100% BMAD compliance — activation structure, menu system, config.yaml integration

**Altitude Engine (Knowledge Graph):**
- Node Registry as queryable knowledge graph: each published newsletter tagged with ACM modules, frameworks, themes, connections
- Semantic similarity detection across all published nodes in < 10 seconds
- Connection discovery: "Show me all nodes related to [topic]" returns territory map
- Temporal filtering: 3/6/12 months, all-time views in < 5 seconds
- Thematic drilling: From broad themes → specific mentions in < 3 seconds
- Territory report generation after publishing in < 30 seconds
- Visual mapping: Territory presented as navigable landscape (not just lists)

**Dual Mode Architecture:**
- Structured Mode: Linear workflow execution (Inject → Transform → Return → Repurpose) with automatic territory mapping
- Freeform Mode: Conversational interface for "Take me to 10,000 feet on [topic]" cartographic exploration
- Seamless switching between modes based on user creative state

**Session Management:**
- Conversation memory across entire creative session
- Multi-agent dialogue support (agents talk to each other, not just to user)
- Fluid handoffs between workflows (one continuous conversation feeling)
- Session state persistence (pause, return tomorrow, continue seamlessly with agents who remember context)

### Measurable Outcomes

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Agent invocation: < 2 seconds
- Inject workflow: < 30 seconds to capture emphasis
- Transform workflow: 50%+ time savings vs manual execution
- Return workflow: < 60 seconds to re-enter any node with full context
- Repurpose workflow: 3-5 social posts in < 5 minutes
- Altitude analysis: < 10 seconds for entire corpus, < 5 seconds for temporal filtering
- Territory report: < 30 seconds after publishing
- Zero behavioral drift in agent outputs (verified through side-by-side testing)

**Qualitative Outcomes:**
- "This feels like MY system amplified" (vs "a tool replaced my process")
- Flow state preserved and extended throughout sessions
- Creative confidence increases through agent collaboration
- Altitude moments: "I didn't know I was exploring that territory"
- Agents feel like creative partners, not tools

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Rabbit — The Structured Mode Workflow (Primary Use)

**Opening Scene:**
It's Tuesday morning. Rabbit wakes up with an intuition spark about "consciousness and AI adoption" — a connection he's been feeling but hasn't fully articulated. He grabs his coffee and opens NotebookLM, uploads his research sources and rough notes. The system generates a first podcast, and Rabbit listens while making breakfast.

But something's missing. The insight is there, but he hasn't captured his emphasis — the specific angle he wants to pronounce. He knows from experience that if he doesn't capture this NOW, before the boiling phase completes, he'll lose 80% of the nuance.

**Rising Action:**
Rabbit activates the Conscious-Founder module's **Inject workflow**. The interface is simple, conversational — zero friction. He spends 45 seconds typing: "Emphasize THIS angle: Leaders think AI adoption is technical, but it's actually a consciousness gap. The smartest organizations have the most conscious humans, not the best tools."

He hits save. The module captures his emphasis and waits.

Three days later, the boiling phase completes. Rabbit has listened to the second podcast, let connections compound in memory. He's ready. He activates the **Transform workflow** with a single command: "Run K2M on this transcript."

The Analyst agent loads automatically, extracts insights, and pauses at **Checkpoint 1** — exactly where Rabbit's judgment matters. Rabbit provides his thesis, his resonances, his target reader. The Architect agent builds the structure, pauses at **Checkpoint 2**. Rabbit approves the Systemic Trap pattern, confirms the title.

The Copywriter writes the draft. The Editor reviews against the litmus test. **Checkpoint 4** — Rabbit approves the final piece. The entire process took 22 minutes instead of the usual 45+. But more importantly, his emphasis from three days ago was preserved perfectly.

**Climax:**
The piece publishes. The module's basic Node Registry tracks it: "Consciousness Gap in AI — Jan 2025 — Systemic Trap pattern."

Later that week, Rabbit wants to see what he's written about "agency." A simple query shows his 7 previous pieces on that theme. He picks one from 4 months ago, activates the **Return workflow**. Within 60 seconds, he's looking at the full context — what he wrote, what frameworks he used, what emerged in the boiling phase. He adds a new insight, cross-pollinating from his current work.

The **Repurpose workflow** takes his published piece and generates 5 social posts in 4 minutes. The posts use ACM framework correctly — each one is a complete micro-loop. He posts them directly.

**Resolution:**
Six weeks later, Rabbit has published 8 newsletters using the module. His return-to-node rate has gone from "rarely" to "3x per week" — he's constantly deepening insights, cross-pollinating ideas. The boiling phase is still sacred — but now he has structured ways to plant seeds before boiling and harvest insights after. The module extended his cognition without ever interrupting his flow. He feels like he's writing with a talented ensemble who knows his voice.

### Journey 2: Rabbit — The Edge Case (Lost Flow Recovery)

**Opening Scene:**
Rabbit is in the middle of a chaotic week. Client work exploded, family obligations piled up, he's exhausted. The boiling phase on a transcript completed 3 days ago, but he never captured his emphasis. The nuance is fading from memory.

Normally this would be a lost insight — 80% degradation. But now he has the Inject workflow.

**Rising Action:**
Rabbit opens the Inject workflow. Even though the boiling phase is done, the interface asks: "What do you remember wanting to emphasize?"

Rabbit types fragments: "Something about... leaders optimizing tools but not consciousness? The smartest orgs have conscious humans not best tools..." The module captures even this partial emphasis. It's not perfect — but it's 40% better than nothing.

He runs Transform anyway. At Checkpoint 1, the Analyst says: "I'm seeing some tension about tool optimization vs consciousness. Is this your angle?" Rabbit: "Yes! Exactly — that's it." The checkpoint conversation helps reconstruct the emphasis from fragments.

**Climax:**
The piece publishes. It's not Rabbit's best work — the emphasis was degraded. But it's publishable, whereas before the module it would have been abandoned or waited weeks to revisit.

The lesson: Even partial flow preservation beats total loss.

**Resolution:**
Rabbit learns that the module works even when life interrupts. The Inject workflow is a safety net. He wishes he'd used it during the boiling phase — but he's grateful the option exists.

### Journey 3: Rabbit — First-Time Module Setup

**Opening Scene:**
Rabbit has decided to wrap his K2M system into a BMAD module. He's sitting with the 11 source documents — the ACM framework, the 4 agent prompts, the transformation workflows, the repurposing framework. He's excited but also nervous: "What if this breaks the essence?"

**Rising Action:**
He starts with the Agent Builder workflow. Converting the first agent (Analyst) feels risky — so much nuance in the prompt. The BMAD structure wraps around the content, preserving every word. He tests it: "Run Analyst on this transcript."

The output arrives. Rabbit compares it side-by-side with the standalone version. **Identical.** The essence survived.

He converts all 4 agents. Each one verified. The knowledge base structure creates single-source-of-truth for the ACM framework. The agents reference it at runtime. This is actually BETTER than his original system — updates propagate automatically.

**Climax:**
Rabbit runs his first full Transform workflow through the module. Inject captures his emphasis. The 4 agents execute with checkpoints. The output publishes. The Node Registry tracks it.

He leans back. "This feels like MY system amplified."

**Resolution:**
The module is installed. The K2M agents appear in his BMAD menu. The workflows are slash commands. Everything works. The boiling phase is untouched, but now there's structure around it. He's ready to create.

### Journey 4: Rabbit — Module Extension (Future Growth)

**Opening Scene:**
Nine months later, Rabbit has used the module extensively. He's published 40+ newsletters. The Node Registry has rich data. He's seeing patterns in his work that he wants to explore more deeply.

He's also wondering: "Could this help other creators?"

**Rising Action:**
Rabbit opens the module code. The structure is clear. The agent-wrapping pattern is documented. He can see how another creator could adapt this for their own agent systems.

He adds documentation showing how to use this as a template. He shares it with the BMAD community as a reference implementation.

**Climax:**
Other creators start using his module as a starting point. They preserve their own frameworks. The pattern spreads: "Wrap your agents, preserve your essence, add structure around your creative process."

**Resolution:**
Rabbit's module becomes a BMAD reference implementation. The Conscious-Founder module helped him AND showed others how to do the same. The essence preservation pattern spreads.

### Journey 5: Future Creator — Using Conscious-Founder as Template

**Opening Scene:**
Alex is a researcher who has developed her own 3-agent system for turning research papers into LinkedIn posts. She's heard about Rabbit's Conscious-Founder module as a reference implementation for "essence-preserving agent wrapping."

**Rising Action:**
Alex downloads the Conscious-Founder module. She studies the folder structure: the agents/, workflows/, knowledge/ directories. She sees how Rabbit's 4 agents were converted with zero semantic loss. She sees the knowledge base pattern — single-source-of-truth for shared frameworks.

She adapts the pattern. Converts her 3 agents using the same structure. Creates her own knowledge base with her framework. Builds her own Inject-Transform-Return workflows.

**Climax:**
Alex runs her first transformed workflow. Her agents produce identical output to her standalone versions — essence preserved. But now she has the structured execution, the state persistence, the workflow orchestration.

**Resolution:**
Alex publishes about her experience. "Conscious-Founder showed me how to wrap my agents without breaking their soul. This pattern is reusable."

The reference implementation spreads. More creators preserve their essence while gaining BMAD structure.

### Journey Requirements Summary

**Core Capabilities Revealed:**
- **Zero-Friction Emphasis Capture:** Inject workflow must be < 30 seconds, conversational interface
- **Checkpoint Preservation:** All 4 checkpoints must pause and wait for user input
- **State Persistence:** Emphasis captured days ago must flow seamlessly into Transform workflow
- **Node Context Retrieval:** Return workflow must show full context in < 60 seconds
- **Side-by-Side Verification:** Essential for essence preservation confidence
- **Recovery from Degradation:** Partial emphasis capture better than total loss
- **Documentation:** Module must serve as reference implementation for future users
- **Template Pattern:** Clear structure that other creators can adapt for their own agent systems

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Flow state preservation throughout all workflows
- "This feels like MY system amplified" — user validation metric
- Zero behavioral drift in wrapped agents (verified through testing)
- Boiling phase remains sacred — module wraps, doesn't replace
- BMAD-native invocation (no custom interfaces, use BMAD menu/slash commands)

**Interface Requirement:**
- NO custom UI — all interactions through BMAD agent menu and slash commands
- Agents invoke via BMAD agent system
- Workflows execute via `/bmad` slash commands
- Simple, CLI-first design following BMAD patterns

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**1. Essence Preservation Pattern (Zero Semantic Loss Agent Wrapping)**

The module introduces a novel approach to converting standalone AI agent prompts into BMAD-wrapped agents while preserving every nuance of the original framework. This "soul preservation" challenge hasn't been systematically solved in the AI agent community.

**What makes it innovative:**
- **Zero semantic loss conversion:** Every prompt nuance, tone instruction, and execution warning preserved verbatim during BMAD wrapping
- **Side-by-side verification protocol:** Systematic testing comparing original agent output vs BMAD-wrapped agent output to ensure behavioral equivalence
- **Knowledge base as single-source-of-truth:** Shared frameworks (ACM, patterns, voice constants) referenced at runtime, preventing divergence when frameworks evolve
- **"The soul survives automation" test:** User validation metric — "Does this feel like MY system amplified?"

**Why it matters:**
Most AI tooling either (a) replaces human creative processes with automation or (b) requires simplifying frameworks to fit technical constraints. This pattern preserves framework complexity while gaining automation benefits.

**Validation approach:**
- Side-by-side output comparison testing for all 4 agents
- Framework compliance verification (all ACM modules present and correct)
- User acceptance testing: "Does this feel like my system?"
- Open-source as BMAD reference implementation for community validation

---

**2. Creative Cartography (Altitude Engine for Pattern Discovery)**

The module introduces "creative altitude" as a first-class capability — the ability to see one's creative work from 10,000 feet to discover patterns, connections, and frameworks that are invisible at ground level.

**What makes it innovative:**
- **Territory mapping:** Treat creative output as navigable landscape — nodes, connections, themes, paradoxes
- **Semantic similarity detection:** Discover connections across months/years of work that the creator didn't realize existed
- **Unknown node discovery:** Flag emerging patterns, recurring tensions, and intuitive frameworks worth formalizing
- **Thematic evolution tracking:** Show how thinking on a topic evolved through distinct phases over time
- **Altitude perspective:** Provide macro view that reveals patterns invisible during creation

**Why it matters:**
Creative professionals work in the weeds — crafting individual pieces without seeing the larger territory of their work. Most analytics tools focus on metrics (views, engagement), not creative patterns (themes, frameworks, evolution). This externalizes intuition into visible maps.

**Three Discovery Types (A, B, C):**
- **A) Thematic Connections:** "You've explored X from 12 angles — here's the evolution map"
- **B) Paradoxes/Tensions:** "This pattern appears in 8 pieces — never named but clearly core"
- **C) Framework Formalization:** "You've been using this instinctively — want to name it?"

**Validation approach:**
- User experiences "altitude moment": "I had NO IDEA I was exploring that territory"
- Territory discovery rate: How many new insights emerge from cartography that wouldn't have surfaced otherwise
- Time savings: "I would have needed 6 months of boiling to see this pattern"

**Risk mitigation:**
- Start with basic Node Registry (MVP) before full Altitude Engine
- Core value (structured workflows) works without cartography
- Altitude Engine is enhancement, not requirement

---

**3. Atelier Collaboration Model (Human-as-Director, Agents-as-Skilled-Ensemble)**

The module challenges the dominant "AI replaces humans" narrative by implementing an atelier model: the creator is the master artist/director, agents are skilled collaborators providing craft expertise while respecting creative vision.

**What makes it innovative:**
- **"Yes, and" collaboration:** Agents build on creator's ideas rather than replacing them
- **Flow state preservation:** Module adds structure AROUND creative process, never attempts to replace intuitive compounding phase
- **Checkpoint philosophy:** "YOUR insights + My pattern recognition + Your judgment + My execution = YOUR voice at scale"
- **Dual mode flexibility:** Structured mode for executing, freeform mode for exploring
- **Creative confidence increase:** Agents amplify (don't replace) creative voice

**Why it matters:**
Most AI writing tools turn humans into reviewers of AI-generated content. The atelier model preserves human judgment at critical checkpoints while using AI for pattern recognition and craft execution. This keeps the human in the director role.

**The "boiling phase" principle:**
"The tool accelerates execution but must never replace the boiling phase where intuition does what AI can't: compound connections across time in your own cognitive architecture."

**Validation approach:**
- User feedback: "This feels like extending cognition, not using software"
- Flow state preserved and extended throughout sessions
- Creative confidence increases through agent collaboration
- Zero behavioral drift in agent outputs

---

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

**Current AI Writing Tools Landscape:**
- **Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic:** Turn humans into reviewers of AI-generated content
- **Notion AI, Cursor:** AI assistance but no framework preservation
- **Custom agent systems:** Require rebuilding from scratch, no essence preservation pattern

**What's missing:**
- Tools that preserve creative frameworks during automation
- Cartographic view of creative patterns over time
- Atelier model keeping humans as directors, not reviewers
- Zero semantic loss when wrapping existing agent systems

**Competitive differentiation:**
- **Framework-first:** Unlike "start fresh" tools, this preserves existing creative IP (ACM framework, agent personas)
- **Creator-centric:** Unlike "AI generates" tools, this keeps creator in director role
- **Territory-aware:** Unlike single-piece focus, this sees creative landscape as territory
- **Reference implementation:** Open pattern for other creators to wrap their own agent systems

---

### Validation Approach

**Essence Preservation Validation:**
1. **Side-by-side testing:** Run identical transcript through standalone agent vs BMAD-wrapped agent, compare outputs byte-for-byte
2. **Framework compliance checklist:** Verify all ACM modules, patterns, and quality gates present
3. **User acceptance test:** Rabbit asks "Does this feel like my system?" — subjective validation is critical
4. **Open-source reference implementation:** Community validates pattern works for other frameworks

**Creative Cartography Validation:**
1. **"Altitude moment" testing:** User experiences realization when seeing territory map
2. **Discovery rate metrics:** Count new insights emerging from cartography vs manual review
3. **Time-to-pattern measurement:** How much faster does cartography reveal patterns vs intuition?
4. **Territory accuracy:** Are flagged connections actually meaningful to creator?

**Atelier Model Validation:**
1. **Flow state measurement:** Does user stay in flow throughout workflows?
2. **Creative confidence survey:** Does user feel more/less confident after using module?
3. **Checkpoint analysis:** Do checkpoints genuinely preserve human judgment or feel like rubber stamps?
4. **"Yes, and" assessment:** Do agents build on ideas or replace them?

---

### Risk Mitigation

**Innovation Risk 1: Essence Preservation Fails**
- **Risk:** BMAD wrapping introduces subtle behavioral drift, framework soul lost
- **Mitigation:** Side-by-side verification testing for all agents; rollback to standalone documents if drift detected
- **Fallback:** Use BMAD structure for workflows but keep agents as standalone documents

**Innovation Risk 2: Creative Cartography Feels Gimmicky**
- **Risk:** Altitude Engine reveals obvious connections or meaningless patterns
- **Mitigation:** Start with basic Node Registry (MVP), add cartography iteratively based on user feedback
- **Fallback:** Focus on core value (structured workflows) without cartography features

**Innovation Risk 3: Atelier Model Doesn't Scale**
- **Risk:** Collaboration model works for Rabbit but doesn't translate to other creators
- **Mitigation:** Document as reference implementation, let community test with diverse frameworks
- **Fallback:** Position as personal tool first, template second

**Innovation Risk 4: Complexity Explosion**
- **Risk:** Full Altitude Engine takes 2-3 months, delays core value delivery
- **Mitigation:** Phased delivery — MVP first (1-1.5 months), Growth features later based on priority
- **Fallback:** Ship MVP without cartography, validate core workflows work before adding altitude

**Timeline Risk Management:**
- **MVP (1-1.5 months):** Essence preservation + structured workflows + basic node registry
- **Growth (2-3 months additional):** Altitude Engine + cartographic capabilities
- **Vision (4-6 months additional):** Freeform mode + advanced visualization

## Developer Tool Specific Requirements

### Project-Type Overview

Conscious-Founder is a **BMAD developer tool** — specifically, a reference module demonstrating how to preserve creative framework essence during BMAD wrapping. It serves as both a personal tool for Rabbit's K2M workflow and a template for other creators wanting to wrap their agent systems.

**Developer Tool Category:** Module/SDK (BMAD extension)
**Primary Users:**
- Personal: Rabbit (primary user, K2M newsletter workflow)
- Secondary: Other creators with agent systems wanting BMAD integration
**Platform:** BMAD v1.0+ (using stable BMAD Core APIs)

### Development Approach

**BMAD Module Builder Workflow:**

The module will be created using the BMAD Module Builder workflow (`/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-module`) rather than manual construction. This ensures:

- ✅ **Guaranteed BMAD compliance** — Module structure follows BMAD patterns automatically
- ✅ **Faster development** — Workflow generates proper folder structure, config files, installation scripts
- ✅ **Built-in testing** — BMAD compliance validation included
- ✅ **Essence preservation focus** — Manual agent conversion with zero semantic loss, wrapped in BMAD-compliant structure

**Development Process:**
1. Execute `/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-module`
2. Module Builder generates base structure (agents/, workflows/, knowledge/, config.yaml, manifest.yaml, setup.sh)
3. Manually convert 4 K2M agents with zero semantic loss
4. Side-by-side verification testing at each conversion step
5. Build workflows (Inject, Transform, Return, Repurpose) using BMAD workflow patterns
6. Create knowledge base with ACM framework, patterns, voice constants
7. Test installation/uninstall using generated setup scripts
8. Documentation as reference implementation

**This approach combines:** BMAD automation (structure) + Manual craft (essence preservation)

---

### Language & Platform Support

**BMAD Version Requirements:**
- **Minimum BMAD version:** v1.0+
- **Target APIs:** Stable BMAD Core APIs (agent activation, workflow engine, config system)
- **Avoid:** Experimental BMAD features (ensures forward compatibility)
- **Version detection:** Setup script verifies BMAD version, warns if incompatibility detected

**Platform Dependencies:**
- **Required:** BMAD agent system, workflow engine, config.yaml
- **Optional:** BMAD party mode (for multi-agent features), BMAD CLI (for slash commands)
- **Compatibility:** Module should work across all BMAD v1.x releases

**Future-Proofing Strategy:**
- Use documented BMAD Core APIs only (avoid internal/undocumented patterns)
- Structure agents to survive BMAD platform updates
- Test module compatibility as BMAD evolves

---

### Installation Methods

**Primary Installation: Git Clone + Setup Script**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[user]/conscious-founder.git _bmad/modules/conscious-founder

# Run setup script
cd _bmad/modules/conscious-founder
./setup.sh

# Verify installation
./verify-install.sh
```

**"Touch This" vs "Don't Touch" Guidance:**

**✅ DO MODIFY (Your Creative IP):**
- `agents/*.md` — Your agent prompts, personas, communication styles
- `workflows/*.yaml` — Your workflow orchestration, state transitions
- `knowledge/*.md` — Your shared frameworks, patterns, quality gates
- `config.yaml` — Your module configuration settings
- `docs/*.md` — Your documentation for your users

**❌ DON'T TOUCH (BMAD Integration):**
- Agent activation structure (frontmatter format in agent files)
- Menu system format (agent menu YAML structure)
- Workflow state management patterns (BMAD workflow engine requirements)
- `setup.sh`, `uninstall.sh` — BMAD installer integration (unless customizing)
- Agent manifest registration logic

**⚠️ MODIFY CAREFULLY (Pattern Preservation):**
- `knowledge/` folder structure — Add your frameworks, keep single-source-of-truth pattern
- Workflow checkpoint design — Add your checkpoints, keep human-judgment philosophy
- Node registry schema — Extend metadata, keep core structure

**Essence Preservation Verification Script:**

`verify-essence.sh` — Automated side-by-side testing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Essence Preservation Verification Script

AGENT="analyst"
TEST_TRANSCRIPT="test-input.md"

echo "Testing essence preservation for $AGENT..."

# Run standalone version (original)
cat "source/$AGENT.md" | claude "$TEST_TRANSCRIPT" > baseline.md

# Run BMAD-wrapped version
claude "/$AGENT" "$TEST_TRANSCRIPT" > wrapped.md

# Compare
diff baseline.md wrapped.md

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ Essence preserved: Zero semantic loss"
else
  echo "❌ Essence drift detected: Review differences above"
fi
```

### Documentation & Code Examples

**Documentation Philosophy:**
This is a **reference implementation** — documentation must TEACH the essence preservation pattern, not just explain tool usage.

**Required Documentation:**

**1. README.md — Getting Started (5 minutes)**

```markdown
# Conscious-Founder Module

**Preserve creative essence while gaining BMAD structure.**

## What This Does

Wraps your AI agent system in BMAD format with **zero semantic loss** —
every nuance of your framework survives automation.

## Who This Is For

- Creators with existing agent prompts wanting BMAD integration
- Anyone wanting to preserve creative IP while adding automation
- K2M newsletter workflow users (Rabbit's primary use case)

## Quick Start

1. Clone: `git clone [repo] _bmad/modules/conscious-founder`
2. Install: `./setup.sh`
3. Verify: `./verify-install.sh`

## Essence Preservation Philosophy

> "The soul survives automation."

Most AI tooling replaces creative systems with generic automation.
This module adds structure AROUND your creative process without
changing what makes it work.

**Key principle:** Zero semantic loss — every word of your
original agent prompts preserved verbatim.
```

**2. CONVERSION_GUIDE.md — The Heart of Documentation**

**Before/After Examples:**

```markdown
## Essence Preservation: Before & After

### Before: Standalone Agent (Your System)

**File:** `my-agent.md` (traditional format)

```markdown
# My Agent

## Role
You are a specialist in [domain]...

## Task
[Your detailed task description...]

## Tone
[Your voice instructions...]

## Output Format
### Section 1
[Your output specification...]

### Section 2
[More specifications...]
```

### After: BMAD-Wrapped Agent (Zero Semantic Loss)

**File:** `_bmad/modules/my-module/agents/my-agent.md`

```yaml
---
name: "my-agent"
description: "Specialist in [domain]"
icon: "🎯"
menu:
  - item: Run my agent
    exec: workflows/my-workflow.yaml
activation:
  critical: MANDATORY
  steps:
    - Load config
    - Show menu
    - Execute user choice
rules:
  - Always communicate in {communication_language}
  - Stay in character until exit
---
```

```markdown
# My Agent

## Role
You are a specialist in [domain]...

## Task
[Your detailed task description...]

## Tone
[Your voice instructions...]

## Output Format
### Section 1
[Your output specification...]

### Section 2
[More specifications...]
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Frontmatter added:** BMAD activation structure (name, description, icon, menu)
- ✅ **Agent content:** VERBATIM — zero words changed, zero summarizing
- ✅ **Invoke-able:** Menu system provides `/my-agent` command
- ✅ **Result:** Agent behaves identically, gains BMAD integration

**Why This Works:**
BMAD structure wraps AROUND your content, doesn't replace it.
```

**3. TESTING_CHECKLIST.md — Essence Preservation Verification**

```markdown
## Essence Preservation Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Side-by-Side Output Comparison

**Step 1:** Run standalone agent
```bash
cat my-agent.md | claude test-transcript.md > baseline.md
```

**Step 2:** Run BMAD-wrapped agent
```bash
claude /my-agent test-transcript.md > wrapped.md
```

**Step 3:** Compare outputs
```bash
diff baseline.md wrapped.md
```

**Expected Result:** Zero meaningful differences
- ✅ Formatting differences OK (YAML frontmatter adds headers)
- ❌ Content differences = essence drift (investigate!)

### Test 2: Framework Compliance Check

Verify all prompt sections survived:

- [ ] Role section present and unchanged
- [ ] Task section present and unchanged
- [ ] Tone instructions preserved
- [ ] Output format specifications identical
- [ ] Execution warnings included
- [ ] Quality gates present

### Test 3: Behavioral Verification

**Checkpoint Philosophy:** Did human judgment points survive?

- [ ] Checkpoint 1 pauses for user input
- [ ] Checkpoint questions match original
- [ ] User can modify/approve agent output
- [ ] Agent accepts user direction without "helpful" overreach

### Test 4: User Acceptance Test

**The Ultimate Question:**
> "Does this feel like MY system?"

- [ ] Yes — Agent behaves like my original ✅
- [ ] No — Something feels different ❌

**If NO:** Run diff, find what changed, revert to standalone version
```

**4. TUTORIAL.md — Learn By Doing**

```markdown
## Tutorial: Convert Your First Agent

Time: 15 minutes | Difficulty: Easy

You'll learn: The essence preservation pattern by converting a simple agent.

### Step 1: Choose Your Agent

Pick your simplest agent. Let's call it `MyAgent.md`.

### Step 2: Create BMAD Wrapper

Create `_bmad/modules/my-module/agents/my-agent.md`:

```yaml
---
name: "my-agent"
description: "Brief description"
icon: "🎯"
menu:
  - item: Run my agent
    exec: workflows/my-workflow.yaml
---

(Paste your entire MyAgent.md content below, verbatim)
```

**Critical:** Paste EVERY WORD. No summarizing. No "optimizing."

### Step 3: Test It

```bash
# Before (standalone)
cat MyAgent.md | claude

# After (BMAD)
claude /my-agent
```

Compare outputs. They should be identical.

### Step 4: Celebrate 🎉

You just preserved your agent's soul!

### What You Learned

- ✅ BMAD frontmatter = structural wrapper
- ✅ Agent content = unchanged creative IP
- ✅ Zero semantic loss = essence preserved
```

**5. PATTERNS.md — Reusable Patterns**

```markdown
## Essence Preservation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Knowledge Base as Single-Source-of-Truth

**Problem:** Framework duplicated across agents leads to divergence.

**Solution:**

```markdown
# knowledge/shared-framework.md
The Framework content...

# agents/agent1.md
See {knowledge}/shared-framework.md for context...

# agents/agent2.md
See {knowledge}/shared-framework.md for context...
```

**Benefit:** Update framework once, all agents stay synchronized.

### Pattern 2: Checkpoint Philosophy

**Problem:** AI tools remove human judgment.

**Solution:**

```yaml
workflows:
  step1: Agent produces output
  step2: PAUSE_FOR_USER_INPUT # "Your judgment matters"
  step3: Continue with user direction
```

**Benefit:** Human in control at critical decision points.

### Pattern 3: State Persistence

**Problem:** Emphasis captured today lost by tomorrow.

**Solution:**

```yaml
workflows:
  inject.yaml:
    output: saved-emphasis.md
  transform.yaml:
    input: saved-emphasis.md # Context preserved across days
```

**Benefit:** Creative compounding across time.
```

### Implementation Considerations

**Development Phasing:**

**Phase 1: MVP (1-1.5 months)**
- Use BMAD Module Builder workflow to generate base structure
- Convert 4 agents with zero semantic loss
- Create 4 workflows (Inject, Transform, Return, Repurpose)
- Build basic Node Registry
- Write core documentation (README, CONVERSION_GUIDE, TESTING_CHECKLIST)

**Phase 2: Growth (2-3 months additional)**
- Add Altitude Engine (knowledge graph, semantic similarity)
- Implement territory reports
- Add advanced documentation (TUTORIAL, PATTERNS, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- Community testing and feedback

**Phase 3: Vision (4-6 months additional)**
- Freeform mode (conversational cartography)
- Visual territory mapping
- Multi-user capabilities (if desired)

**Essence Preservation as Non-Negotiable:**

Throughout all phases:
- Every agent conversion must pass side-by-side testing
- Framework compliance checklist required for each agent
- User acceptance test ("Does this feel like my system?") must pass
- Rollback strategy: If essence lost, revert to standalone immediately

**BMAD Module Builder Workflow Integration:**

The module builder will handle:
- ✅ Folder structure generation
- ✅ Config.yaml creation
- ✅ Manifest.yaml metadata
- ✅ Setup/uninstall scripts
- ✅ BMAD compliance validation

Manual work (where essence matters):
- ✅ Agent prompt conversion (zero semantic loss)
- ✅ Knowledge base content (shared frameworks)
- ✅ Workflow checkpoint design (human judgment points)
- ✅ Documentation (teaching the pattern)

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Unit Tests (Per Agent):**
   - Side-by-side output comparison
   - Framework compliance checklist
   - Menu invocation test

2. **Integration Tests (Per Workflow):**
   - End-to-end workflow execution
   - State persistence verification
   - Checkpoint functionality test

3. **Essence Tests (System-Wide):**
   - Full K2M pipeline (Inject → Transform → Publish)
   - User acceptance: "Does this feel like my system?"
   - Rollback test: Can we revert to standalone if needed?

4. **Documentation Tests:**
   - Tutorial completion (can someone follow it successfully?)
   - Pattern clarity (do examples make sense?)
   - Reference implementation (can others adapt this?)

## Project Scoping & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Problem-Solving MVP with Complete Vision Delivery

**Philosophy:** Build the complete solution to the core problem in one comprehensive release using AI agentic development. This is a personal tool for Rabbit's creative workflow — not a phased rollout for external users.

**Resource Requirements:**
- **Development Approach:** AI agentic development (accelerated timeline)
- **Target Timeline:** Complete all phases in single development cycle (target: same day)

---

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risk 1: Essence Preservation Fails**
- **Risk:** BMAD wrapping introduces behavioral drift
- **Mitigation:** Side-by-side verification testing at EACH agent conversion; rollback immediately if drift detected
- **Fallback:** Use BMAD structure for workflows, keep agents as standalone documents

**Technical Risk 2: Altitude Engine Complexity**
- **Risk:** Semantic analysis and visualization exceed capabilities
- **Mitigation:** Start with basic text-based territory reports, add visual mapping incrementally
- **Fallback:** Focus on core workflows (Phase 1) if cartography proves infeasible

**Timeline Risk: AI Agentic Development**
- **Risk:** Same-day completion target unrealistic for full vision
- **Mitigation:** AI agents work in parallel on different components; modular architecture enables incremental completion
- **Acceptance:** If timeline extends, all features still required — this is complete vision MVP, not phased rollout

**Scope Risk: Feature Creep**
- **Risk:** Additional features added during development
- **Mitigation:** PRD defines complete scope — any additions deferred to post-MVP iteration
- **Discipline:** Focus on delivering defined features (Phases 1+2+3) rather than expanding scope

**Personal Tool Optimization:**
- **No user validation needed:** This is Rabbit's personal tool — his definition of success is what matters
- **No market timing pressure:** Complete when complete, not when market window closes
- **No external dependencies:** Only Rabbit's K2M system and BMAD platform — no third-party integration risks

---

### Development Approach: AI Agentic

**AI Agent Parallel Execution:**

**Agent 1: Module Builder (Bond/Morgan)**
- Execute `/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-module`
- Generate base structure (agents/, workflows/, knowledge/)
- Create config.yaml, manifest.yaml, setup.sh

**Agent 2: Agent Converter (Manual with AI assistance)**
- Convert 4 K2M agents with zero semantic loss
- Run side-by-side verification tests
- Iterate until behavioral equivalence achieved

**Agent 3: Workflow Architect (Wendy)**
- Build 4 workflows (Inject, Transform, Return, Repurpose)
- Implement state management and checkpoint philosophy
- Test workflow execution end-to-end

**Agent 4: Knowledge Base Curator (Paige)**
- Extract and organize ACM framework from source documents
- Create knowledge base structure
- Verify agents can reference shared frameworks

**Agent 5: Altitude Engineer (Winston + Creative)**
- Implement semantic similarity detection
- Build knowledge graph and connection discovery
- Create territory report generation
- Develop visual territory mapping

**Agent 6: Documentation Writer (Paige)**
- Write all documentation files (README, CONVERSION_GUIDE, TESTING_CHECKLIST, TUTORIAL, PATTERNS, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- Create code examples and before/after demonstrations
- Test tutorial completeness

**Parallel Execution Strategy:**
- Agents 2-6 work in parallel after Agent 1 completes base structure
- Continuous integration: Each component tested independently
- Final integration: All components assembled and tested together

**Timeline Target:** Single development cycle (same day completion)

**Success Metric:** All features from Phases 1+2+3 working in Rabbit's environment
