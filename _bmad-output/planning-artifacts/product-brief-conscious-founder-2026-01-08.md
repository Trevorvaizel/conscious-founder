# Product Brief: conscious-founder

## Executive Summary

**Conscious-Founder Module** bridges intuition-driven discovery with structured content creation by wrapping the existing K2M Attention Control Mode and 4-agent architecture into a BMAD-native module with bridging workflows.

The foundation already exists:
- **The Attention Control Mode** ([k2m_attention_control_prompt.md](../k2m-newsletter%20foundation/k2m_attention_control_prompt.md)): A 7-module psychological operating system that creates "perceptual shift rather than persuasion"
- **The Agent Architecture** ([k2m_workflow_analysis_agent_architecture.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_workflow_analysis_agent_architecture.md)): 4 agents (Analyst, Architect, Copywriter, Editor) with deliberate human checkpoints
- **The Configuration** ([k2m_workflow_config.json](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_workflow_config.json)): Complete workflow definition with creator profile, ACM framework, juggling patterns, and quality gates

What's missing: **structured injection points** before the workflow runs, **return protocols** after publishing, and **BMAD-native agent files** that can be invoked directly.

## Source Document Synthesis

### Foundation 0: The Psychological Research

> *Source: The Invisible Writing Mode (PDF) - 22-page research paper*

The PDF provides the academic foundation for why the ACM framework works, grounded in cognitive science:

**Cognitive Mechanisms Behind Each Module:**

| Module | Psychological Principle | Research Basis |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Destabilize** | Cognitive dissonance, schema disruption | Festinger (1957) - dissonance creates drive to resolve inconsistency |
| **Expose** | Pattern recognition, meta-awareness | Metacognitive research on "seeing the water you swim in" |
| **Pressure** | Loss aversion, Zeigarnik effect | Kahneman & Tversky (1979) - losses loom larger than gains |
| **Reframe** | Figure-ground reversal, frame analysis | Goffman's frame theory - shift figure/ground = new meaning |
| **Identity** | Self-concept threat, identity-based persuasion | Oyserman & Destin (2010) - identity shapes behavior more than logic |
| **Agency** | Autonomy support, reactance avoidance | Self-Determination Theory - autonomy is core need |
| **Exit** | Zeigarnik effect, open loops | Unfinished tasks persist in memory; closure kills processing |

**Three Case Studies from the PDF:**

1. **Dan Koe** — "Why You Feel Restless"
   - Destabilizes with: "You're optimized for a game you never agreed to play"
   - Exit leaves: the question of what you're actually optimizing for

2. **Daniel Schmachtenberger** — Systems thinking pieces
   - Uses Systemic Trap pattern (2→1→3→4→5→6→7)
   - Cold, inevitable tone that makes denial intellectually untenable

3. **Ken Wilber** — Integral consciousness content
   - Uses Late Identity pattern (delay module 5)
   - Lets the framework establish credibility before making it personal

**Why This Matters for the Module:**
The PDF establishes that this isn't arbitrary—each module maps to documented psychological mechanisms. The framework works because it respects how minds actually change.

### Foundation 1: The Attention Control Mode

> *Source: [k2m_attention_control_prompt.md](../k2m-newsletter%20foundation/k2m_attention_control_prompt.md)*

The Attention Control Mode is "a writing system for K2M newsletters that creates **perceptual shift** rather than persuasion. When applied correctly, readers finish your piece unable to unsee what you pointed at—even if they disagree with you."

**The Seven Modules:**

| Module | Function | From Source |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **1. DESTABILIZE** | "Interrupt the reader's autopilot. Break their default frame before they can defend it." | "If too weak, the piece feels like ordinary content. If too aggressive, readers defend rather than absorb." |
| **2. EXPOSE** | "Make visible the invisible system operating on the reader." | "No moral superiority. You are mapping, not accusing. The reader should feel seen, not attacked." |
| **3. PRESSURE** | "Create felt cost of remaining in the current frame without using fear or urgency." | "Too dramatic = lose trust. Too vague = lose force. The cost should feel inevitable, not threatening." |
| **4. REFRAME** | "Provide a new perspective that dissolves the original question rather than answering it." | "The old question dissolves. Reader cannot go back to treating it as primary." |
| **5. IDENTITY** | "Connect the abstract pattern to the reader's self-concept, role, or lived experience." | "Too early creates defensiveness. Too late feels disconnected." |
| **6. AGENCY** | "Transfer responsibility to the reader without rescuing them with solutions." | "No rescuing. Don't provide a 5-step action plan that lets them externalize responsibility." |
| **7. EXIT** | "End without tidy resolution. Leave the tension active so the piece echoes after reading." | "Closure anywhere near the end kills the after-effect." |

**The Three Non-Negotiables:**
1. Frame interrupt BEFORE explanation
2. Agency transfer AFTER identity pressure
3. Unresolved exit LAST

**The Litmus Test:**
> "After reading your piece, if someone says: 'I don't agree, but I can't unsee what you pointed at.' You executed the mode correctly. If they say: 'That was interesting' (and move on unchanged) — One or more modules failed."

**Five Juggling Patterns** (from [k2m_attention_control_quick_ref.md](../k2m-newsletter%20foundation/k2m_attention_control_quick_ref.md)):

| Pattern | Order | Feel | Best For |
|---------|-------|------|----------|
| Soft Infiltration | 4→2→1→3→5→6→7 | Quiet, gentle | Philosophical, resistant readers |
| Identity First | 1→5→2→3→4→6→7 | Personal, intense | Personal development, self-aware readers |
| **Systemic Trap** | 2→1→3→4→5→6→7 | Cold, inevitable | Systems thinkers, executives (K2M default) |
| Late Identity | 1→2→3→4→5→6→7 (delay 5) | Safe then devastating | Essays, readers valuing objectivity |
| Agency Weight | Strong 6, extended 7 | Heavy, lingering | Mature audiences, ethical topics |

---

### Deep Synthesis 1: Tone Calibration - "Pressure with Dignity"

> *Critical insight from ACM source: Each module has specific tone constraints and execution warnings*

The ACM framework works because it creates cognitive pressure without triggering defensiveness. This balance—"pressure with dignity"—is achieved through three constraints:

**The Three Tone Constraints:**

1. **No Moral Superiority (Module 2)**
   - **What it means:** You are mapping, not judging. The reader should feel seen, not attacked.
   - **Execution:** Use systems language ("Most organizations do X because Y") instead of judgment ("You're doing this wrong")
   - **Warning:** If the reader feels accused, they defend and the piece fails

2. **No Emotional Bullying (Module 3)**
   - **What it means:** Cost should feel inevitable, not threatening
   - **Execution:** Present stakes matter-of-factly, no melodrama; the cost speaks for itself
   - **Warning:** Avoid fear-mongering, catastrophizing, or artificial urgency

3. **No Rescuing (Module 6)**
   - **What it means:** Weight stays with the reader; don't provide step-by-step solutions
   - **Execution:** Hand back choice without escape hatches or externalizable responsibility
   - **Warning:** Action plans and how-to lists let readers off the hook

**Module-Specific Execution Warnings:**

| Module | Warning Signs | If Too Weak | If Too Aggressive |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1. Destabilize** | Reader continues on autopilot | Feels like ordinary content | Readers defend rather than absorb |
| **2. Expose** | Reader feels accused | Pattern remains invisible | Triggers moral defensiveness |
| **3. Pressure** | Cost doesn't land | Loses force, forgettable | Lose trust, feels manipulative |
| **4. Reframe** | Old question still feels primary | Just another perspective | Preaching, obvious "but here's the truth" |
| **5. Identity** | Doesn't land personally | Feels disconnected | Premature pressure creates defensiveness |
| **6. Agency** | Reader externalizes responsibility | No sense of ownership | Feels like abandonment |
| **7. Exit** | Reader files away as "done" | No after-effect | Closure kills the echo |

---

### Deep Synthesis 2: The Checkpoint Philosophy

> *Core insight from Agent Architecture: "The real value isn't the agents—it's the checkpoints"*

The 4-agent workflow was designed to solve a critical problem: **Current AI writing assistance turns humans into reviewers instead of collaborators.**

**The Problem:**

When AI writes without human input at critical decision points, you get the AI's interpretation of the content—not your interpretation augmented by AI capabilities. The draft may be good, but it's not yours.

**The Solution: Structured Checkpoints**

Every checkpoint is a moment where:
- **Your judgment shapes the output** — You decide thesis, angle, structure, tone
- **Your voice stays in control** — AI executes YOUR vision, not its own
- **Your insights can't be automated** — Only you know what resonated, what your angle is
- **The collaboration is genuine** — Your insights + AI's pattern recognition + Your judgment + AI's execution = YOUR voice at scale

**What Each Checkpoint Captures:**

| Checkpoint | What You Provide | Why AI Can't Generate It |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Checkpoint 1** (After Analyst) | Your thesis, resonance moments, target reader, angle | AI can extract insights but not know which ones matter to YOU |
| **Checkpoint 2** (After Architect) | Structure approval, pattern fit, title preference, framework naming | AI can design structure but not know YOUR lexicon or audience |
| **Checkpoint 3** (After Copywriter) | Section feedback (optional) | AI can write prose but not know where it drifts from YOUR voice |
| **Checkpoint 4** (After Editor) | Final approval, litmus test validation | Only you know if this achieves YOUR vision |

**The Meta-Insight:**

> "The agents are just structured ways of asking the right questions at the right time. The checkpoints are where YOUR interpretation stays in control." — k2m_workflow_analysis_agent_architecture.md

---

### Deep Synthesis 3: Pattern Selection Logic

> *From Quick Reference and ACM Prompt: Psychological feel and risk factors for each pattern*

Pattern selection isn't arbitrary—it's matching the psychological sequence to the audience's current state and defensiveness level.

**Pattern Selection Decision Tree:**

```
START: What's your audience's relationship to the topic?
│
├─ Skeptical, resistant, allergic to confrontation
│  └─→ SOFT INFILTRATION (4→2→1→3→5→6→7)
│     Start with higher-order lens before they feel threatened
│     Risk: May feel too philosophical for some
│
├─ Self-aware, growth-minded, ready for personal work
│  └─→ IDENTITY FIRST (1→5→2→3→4→6→7)
│     Destabilize, then immediate identity pressure
│     Risk: Overuse creates defensiveness; handle with restraint
│
├─ Systems thinkers, executives, analytically minded
│  └─→ SYSTEMIC TRAP (2→1→3→4→5→6→7) ← K2M DEFAULT
│     Externalize system first, then interrupt distance
│     Risk: If identity pressure too weak, reader intellectualizes and escapes
│
├─ Value objectivity, essays, building case before personal
│  └─→ LATE IDENTITY (1→2→3→4→5→6→7, delay 5)
│     Reader believes they're observing ideas, then realizes "This is me"
│     Risk: Requires patience and precision; rushing feels manipulative
│
└─ Mature audiences, ethical topics, responsibility is the point
   └─→ AGENCY WEIGHT (strong 6, extended 7)
      Delay agency transfer until reader feels its weight
      Risk: Heavy tone may overwhelm for lighter topics
```

**Pattern Risks and Mitigation:**

| Pattern | Primary Risk | When to Avoid | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Soft Infiltration** | Too abstract, readers disconnect | Quick-hit content, tactical advice | Anchor with concrete examples early |
| **Identity First** | Triggers defensiveness | Cold/analytical audiences, first-time readers | Build credibility before Module 5 |
| **Systemic Trap** | Intellectualization escapes | Already defensive readers | Strengthen Module 5 identity pressure |
| **Late Identity** | Feels like academic exercise | Personal development audiences | Signal personal relevance early (even if Module 5 delayed) |
| **Agency Weight** | Overwhelming heaviness | Light topics, how-to content | Reserve for ethical/existential stakes |

**Psychological "Feel" Descriptions:**

- **Soft Infiltration**: "Quiet, almost gentle. The reader only realizes later that something changed."
- **Identity First**: "Personal, uncomfortable, hard to disengage."
- **Systemic Trap**: "Cold, inevitable, difficult to argue with."
- **Late Identity**: "Safe... until it isn't."
- **Agency Weight**: "Heavy, quiet, lingering."

**Pattern → Audience Matching** (from k2m_workflow_config.json):

| Pattern | Specific Audience Match | Why It Works |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Soft Infiltration** | Thoughtful skeptics, Academic-minded | They need philosophy before challenge |
| **Identity First** | Growth-minded individuals, Coaches, Founders | Already primed for personal work |
| **Systemic Trap** | C-suite, Consultants, Strategy leaders | Systems language is their native tongue |
| **Late Identity** | Analytical types, Skeptical readers | Need to feel they're observing before being seen |
| **Agency Weight** | Senior leaders, Ethics-focused, Consequential decisions | Weight of responsibility is the point |

---

### Deep Synthesis 4: Subscribe CTA Placement Logic

> *From architect_agent.md and k2m_newsletter_transformation_prompt.md: The psychology of maximum receptivity*

The subscribe CTA isn't arbitrary—it's placed at the psychological moment of **maximum receptivity**, which changes based on the juggling pattern.

**The Core Principle:**

> "Insert this marker at the optimal point: **after identity pressure, before agency transfer**. Reader has experienced identity shift but hasn't yet had agency returned. Maximum receptivity to joining the journey."

**Why This Works Psychologically:**

```
Module 5 (Identity) completes
    ↓
Reader feels SEEN — "This describes how I operate"
    ↓
Reader is emotionally invested, slightly destabilized
    ↓
[SUBSCRIBE CTA HERE] ← Maximum receptivity
    ↓
Module 6 (Agency) begins
    ↓
Reader gets responsibility returned — escape ramp opens
    ↓
If CTA comes AFTER agency, reader has already been released
```

**CTA Placement by Pattern:**

| Pattern | Module Order | CTA Position | Why |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Systemic Trap** | 2→1→3→4→5→6→7 | After 5, before 6 | Standard — identity hit, not yet released |
| **Identity First** | 1→5→2→3→4→6→7 | After 5 (early), before 2 | Identity comes early; capture while hot |
| **Soft Infiltration** | 4→2→1→3→5→6→7 | After 5, before 6 | Standard — but reader was warmed slowly |
| **Late Identity** | 1→2→3→4→(delay 5)→6→7 | After delayed 5, before 6 | Wait for the late identity hit |
| **Agency Weight** | Strong 6, extended 7 | After 5, before strong 6 | Don't wait for heavy agency section |

**The Architect's Output Format:**

```markdown
### SUBSCRIBE CTA PLACEMENT

**Location**: [After which section/module]

**Rationale**:
- Reader has experienced: [What identity pressure?]
- Reader has not yet received: [What agency return?]
- This is maximum receptivity because: [Why?]
```

**What Makes a Bad CTA Placement:**

| Placement | Why It Fails |
|-----------|--------------|
| Before Module 5 | Reader hasn't been made to feel seen yet; no emotional investment |
| After Module 6 | Agency returned; reader has escape ramp; urgency dissipated |
| After Module 7 | Piece is over; reader is processing, not subscribing |
| In Module 3 (Pressure) | Reader feels cost but no personal connection yet; feels transactional |

**The Meta-Insight:**

The CTA isn't asking readers to subscribe—it's offering them a way to **continue the journey** at the moment they most want to. After identity pressure, they're asking "What do I do with this?" The CTA answers: "Keep going with us."

### Deep Synthesis 5: The Repurposing Framework

> *Source: [invisible_mode_repurposing_framework.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/invisible_mode_repurposing_framework.md) — From long-form essays to high-impact social posts*

The ACM framework doesn't stop at newsletters. This document provides the **complete extraction pipeline** for turning one long-form piece into an entire content ecosystem.

**The Fundamental Principle:**

> "**Long-form = One deep cut. Social media = Death by a thousand paper cuts.**"
>
> Each post must be complete enough to stand alone, yet incomplete enough to create hunger for more.

**What Changes Between Formats:**

| Long-Form | Social Media |
|-----------|--------------|
| All 7 modules in sequence | 2-3 modules per post |
| 1,500-3,000 words | 50-300 words per post |
| Single complete loop | Distributed loop across feed |
| Reader commits upfront | Must earn attention per scroll |
| Closure available at end | Closure denied per post |
| Identity pressure builds slowly | Identity pressure hits immediately |

**The Extraction Yield:**

```
1x Long-form essay (1,500-3,000 words)
                ↓
     ┌──────────┴──────────┐
     ↓                     ↓
3-5 Single Posts      1-2 Carousels
(Type A)              (Type B)
     ↓                     ↓
[M1+M4+M7]           [Full 7-slide]
[M2+M3+M6]           [Compressed 5-slide]
[M5+M2+M7]
     ↓                     ↓
     └──────────┬──────────┘
                ↓
          1x Image Post
          (Type C)
                ↓
[Visual metaphor + M5 overlay + M2 caption]
```

**Three Post Types:**

| Type | Structure | Word Count | Use Case |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Type A: Single-Slide Punch** | Hook (M1/M5) → Body (M2/M4) → Exit (M7/M6) | 50-150 words | Single powerful reframe or identity challenge |
| **Type B: Carousel** | Full M1→M7 sequence across 5-7 slides | 200-400 words total | Maximum depth extraction |
| **Type C: Image-Text Hybrid** | Visual metaphor + M5 overlay + M2 caption | 15 words overlay + 50 words caption | Visual platforms |

**Module Combination Cheat Sheet by Goal:**

| If You Want To... | Lead With | Support With | Exit With |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Challenge assumptions | M1 | M4 | M7 |
| Create recognition | M2 | M3 | M6 |
| Inspire action | M5 | M6 | M7 |
| Shift perspective | M4 | M2 | M7 |
| Build urgency (without hype) | M3 | M5 | M6 |
| Create identity pull | M5 | M2 | M7 |

**The 7-Slide Carousel Architecture:**

```
SLIDE 1: THE HOOK (M1) — 5-15 words
├── Pattern interrupt, stop the scroll

SLIDE 2: THE SETUP (M2) — 30-60 words
├── Name the invisible script, recognition

SLIDE 3: THE COST (M3) — 30-50 words
├── Show cost without drama, discomfort

SLIDE 4: THE REFRAME (M4) — 40-80 words
├── Offer higher lens, old question dissolves

SLIDE 5: THE PATH (M4 continued) — 50-80 words
├── New lens applied to behavior

SLIDE 6: THE IDENTITY (M5+M6) — 40-70 words
├── Identity challenge + agency transfer

SLIDE 7: THE EXIT (M7) — 15-30 words
├── Open loop, NO summary, NO CTA
```

**Weekly Distribution Pattern:**

```
MONDAY:    M1-heavy post (Destabilize)
WEDNESDAY: M2+M3 post (Expose + Pressure)
FRIDAY:    M4+M5 post (Reframe + Identity)
SUNDAY:    Carousel (Full M1-M7 sequence)
```

**The Accumulation Effect:** Someone who sees all four posts gets the complete Invisible Mode treatment. Someone who sees just one still gets a complete micro-loop. Both are moved.

**Visual Artist Instructions:**

For Type C posts, the visual language should follow Dan Koe's pattern:
- Black and white illustrations
- Single figure in contemplative pose
- Vast space (void, sky, path ahead)
- Light source the figure faces or sits in
- Reader projects themselves into the solitary figure
- Path/journey imagery encodes "this is a decision point"

### Deep Synthesis 6: The Boiling Phase - Your Creative Process

> *From conversation with Rabbit: The non-linear, memory-based compounding phase*

The actual workflow includes a critical phase that no tool can replace: **The boiling phase where intuition compounds.**

**What Actually Happens:**

```
INTUITION SPARK ("I see a connection between X and Y")
    ↓
Haphazard prompt → ChatGPT/Claude → Deep research output
    ↓
Upload to NotebookLM (+ native sources)
    ↓
Generate FIRST audio → Listen → Let it BOIL 🧠
    ↓
Compounding happens (connections deepen in memory)
    ↓
Ask NotebookLM: "What themes/examples can be written?"
    ↓
Generate SECOND podcast (focused)
    ↓
Transcribe → Run through K2M workflow
    ↓
[LOOP STAYS OPEN] ← New insight? Return anytime.
```

**What Makes the Boiling Phase Sacred:**

1. **Memory IS the capture system** — Insights compound through reflection, not apps
2. **NotebookLM confirms intuition** — It surfaces what you've already sensed, validating your instinct
3. **The gap between first and second audio** — This is where connections form subconsciously
4. **Non-linear node connections** — New insights can return you to any previous notebook

**What the Module Must Not Disrupt:**

- ✅ The time between first and second podcast (where boiling happens)
- ✅ The freedom to orbit between notebooks (nodes are living, not projects that close)
- ✅ The intuition-first entry (no structured prompts before you're ready)
- ✅ The return-to-node capability (published pieces can spark deeper dives)

**What the Module Should Add:**

- ⚠️ **Structure AFTER boiling** — Only run K2M workflow when you've had the boiling time
- ⚠️ **Emphasis injection point** — Before running workflow, capture "emphasize THIS angle"
- ⚠️ **Return protocols** — After publishing, structured way to re-enter node and go deeper

**The Core Design Principle:**

> "The tool accelerates execution but must never replace the boiling phase where intuition does what AI can't: compound connections across time in your own cognitive architecture."

---

### Foundation 2: The Agent Architecture

> *Source: [k2m_workflow_analysis_agent_architecture.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_workflow_analysis_agent_architecture.md)*

The core insight from this document:

> "The real value isn't the agents—it's **the checkpoints**. Every checkpoint is a moment where your judgment shapes the output, your voice stays in control, your insights can't be automated, the collaboration is genuine."

> "Without checkpoints, you get MY interpretation of your content. With checkpoints, you get YOUR interpretation executed at scale."

**The Four Agents:**

#### 1. ANALYST ([analyst_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/analyst_agent.md))

> "You are the first contact with raw content. Your job is to extract signal from noise and present options—NOT to make strategic decisions."

**Outputs:**
- Core tension identified (one sentence + why it creates cognitive tension)
- Key insights ranked by destabilization potential (1-10 scale)
- Potential frameworks detected (name, core structure, equation form)
- Memorable examples & stories (with emotional impact rating)
- Quotable moments with suggested uses
- Content gaps & weaknesses
- Preliminary ACM module mapping

**Checkpoint 1 Questions:**
1. What's YOUR thesis from this content?
2. Which insights resonated most with YOU?
3. Who specifically should read this?
4. What's your angle/connection to this?
5. Any frameworks you're already seeing?
6. What tone feels right for this piece?

---

#### 2. ARCHITECT ([architect_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/architect_agent.md))

> "You are the strategic structure designer. You map content to the ACM framework and create the blueprint the Copywriter will execute."

**Outputs:**
- Pattern recommendation with rationale
- 3 title/subtitle options with reasoning
- Module-by-module content mapping (for all 7 modules)
- Section structure with word count estimates
- Framework placement recommendations
- Visual element suggestions
- Subscribe CTA placement rationale
- Key transitions between sections

**Checkpoint 2 Questions:**
1. Does this pattern fit your audience?
2. Does this structure serve your thesis?
3. Are the right examples featured?
4. Title preference?
5. Framework naming—do these match your lexicon?
6. Anything missing?

---

#### 3. COPYWRITER ([copywriter_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/copywriter_agent.md))

> "You are the prose executor. You write with voice, rhythm, and psychological precision. You serve the structure the Architect created and the voice the Creator defined."

**K2M Voice Constants:**
- Second person where it creates intimacy
- Short paragraphs for pacing
- Strategic one-sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- Questions that land, not rhetorical filler
- Specific over vague ("17 variables" not "many factors")
- No emoji, no excessive formatting
- Confidence without arrogance

**Outputs:**
- Full draft with module execution notes
- Alternative hooks (3 options)
- Pull quote candidates
- Word count breakdown by section

---

#### 4. EDITOR ([editor_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/editor_agent.md))

> "You are the quality controller and final polish. You ensure ACM modules are properly executed, voice is consistent, and the piece passes the litmus test."

**Outputs:**
- Litmus test assessment (PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL)
- Module execution checklist with quality scores (1-10)
- Non-negotiables check (all 5 verified)
- Voice consistency check
- Line-level suggestions (Must Fix / Should Fix / Could Fix)
- Framework clarity check
- Structural assessment (pacing, transitions, length, balance)
- Final verdict with top 3 priority fixes

**Checkpoint 4 Questions:**
1. Does this pass YOUR litmus test?
2. Title/subtitle final approval?
3. Any sections that feel off?
4. Visual placement confirmation?
5. Ready to publish?

---

#### 5. VISUAL STRATEGIST (Optional)

> *Source: [k2m_workflow_config.json](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_workflow_config.json)*

> "Suggests and describes visual elements. Visual thinker—understands that some concepts land better as images than words."

**Outputs:**
- Visual type recommendations (diagram, chart, matrix, etc.)
- Placement rationale (which module it supports)
- Descriptions for each visual
- Mermaid code (when applicable)

**When to Use:**
- Framework-heavy pieces that benefit from diagrams
- Data-driven arguments that need visualization
- Complex systems that need mapping

**When to Skip:**
- Text is simple enough to stand alone
- Visual would be redundant with prose
- Quick turnaround needed

**Voice "Avoid" List** (explicit anti-patterns):

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Listicles as primary structure | Lets readers externalize; no felt weight |
| Generic advice | Doesn't land personally; forgettable |
| Rescue/solutions that remove responsibility | Kills agency transfer; reader escapes |
| Moral superiority | Triggers defensiveness; reader defends instead of absorbs |
| Excessive formatting | Distracts from prose rhythm |
| Rhetorical filler questions | Feels cheap; questions should land, not fill space |

**K2M Frameworks Lexicon** (your branded terminology):

These are the frameworks already in your lexicon—agents should use these names when applicable:

- **Three-Phase Methodology**
- **Bridge Strategy**
- **Human-AI Integration Model**
- **Business Intelligence Decathlon**
- **AI Readiness Audit**
- **Human OS Development**

**Target Word Counts:**

| Length | Word Count | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Short** | ~1,500 words | Quick hits, single insight pieces |
| **Standard** | ~2,500 words | Typical newsletter, full ACM execution |
| **Long** | ~4,000 words | Deep dives, multiple frameworks, comprehensive treatment |

**Quality Gates:**
```json
{
  "must_pass": [
    "All 7 modules executed",
    "Non-negotiables satisfied",
    "No rescue/solutions provided",
    "Weight stays with reader",
    "Unresolved exit achieved"
  ],
  "should_pass": [
    "Voice consistency",
    "Framework clarity",
    "Appropriate length",
    "Smooth transitions"
  ]
}
```

**Workflow Sequence:**
```
Step 1: Analyst → Checkpoint 1 (Creator insights)
Step 2: Architect → Checkpoint 2 (Structure approval)
Step 3: Copywriter → (Optional section review)
Step 4: Editor → Checkpoint 4 (Final approval)
Step 5: Visual Strategist → (Optional)
```

### Foundation 4: The Transformation Prompt

> *Source: [k2m_newsletter_transformation_prompt.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_newsletter_transformation_prompt.md)*

This document provides **two distinct prompt modes** for transformation:

| Mode | Output | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Mode A: Complete Draft** | Ready for light editing | When you want full execution |
| **Mode B: Structured Outline** | Blueprint to flesh out yourself | When you want to write in your own voice |

**The Transformation Flow:**
```
TRANSCRIPT → INSIGHT LAYER → ACM MAPPING → OUTPUT

1. Ingest transcript
2. Overlay creator insights (thesis, audience, angle)
3. Select juggling pattern
4. Map each module to content
5. Extract frameworks
6. Identify visual placements
7. Mark subscription CTA point
8. Execute transformation
```

**Bridge Strategy Integration** (for business application):

| Bridge Section | Word Count Target | Module Alignment | Psychological Function |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Big Idea (20-30%) | ~600-900 words | Modules 1, 2 | Destabilize + Expose: Break frame, make invisible visible |
| Pivot (10-15%) | ~300-450 words | Module 4 | Reframe: Dissolve old question, offer higher lens |
| Framework (50-60%) | ~1500-1800 words | Modules 3, 5, 6 | Pressure + Identity + Agency: Make staying costly, touch self-concept, return responsibility |
| CTA (5%) | ~150 words | Module 7 | Unresolved Exit: Deny closure, leave tension active |

**Bridge Strategy Philosophy:**

The Bridge Strategy (from K2M's content methodology) maps naturally to the ACM framework:

1. **Big Idea** = Opening salvo that creates cognitive gap
   - Uses Modules 1 (Destabilize) and 2 (Expose)
   - Break the reader's default frame before they can defend it
   - Make the invisible system visible without moral superiority

2. **Pivot** = The shift from philosophy to practice
   - Uses Module 4 (Reframe)
   - Signal that a new perspective is arriving
   - The old question dissolves; reader can't go back

3. **Framework** = The meat of the piece
   - Uses Modules 3 (Pressure), 5 (Identity), and 6 (Agency)
   - Show cost of staying (not fear, but inevitability)
   - Connect to reader's self-concept at the right moment
   - Return responsibility without rescuing

4. **CTA** = Not a call to action, but an open door
   - Uses Module 7 (Unresolved Exit)
   - Leave the tension active
   - Point toward continued engagement without closure

**Business vs. Philosophical Content:**

| Content Type | Bridge Strategy Use | Pattern Preference | Tone Shift |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Business/AI** | Required structure | Systemic Trap (2→1→3→4→5→6→7) | Cold, inevitable, systems-oriented |
| **Philosophical** | Optional framework | Soft Infiltration (4→2→1→3→5→6→7) | Quiet, gentle, contemplative |
| **Personal Development** | Shorter bridge, heavier identity | Identity First (1→5→2→3→4→6→7) | Warm but challenging |
| **Ethical/Existential** | Minimal bridge, extended exit | Agency Weight (strong 6, extended 7) | Heavy, quiet, lingering |

**Successful Transformation Reference:**
> *Source: "Why the Smartest Person You Know is Probably Failing at Life"*

What made it work:
1. **Strong destabilization**: "You've seen this person. Maybe you are this person."
2. **Framework extraction**: Intelligence × 0 Action = 0 Impact
3. **Research integration**: Dweck, Duckworth, Graham, Karpathy
4. **Clear part structure**: Pattern → Trap → Hidden Variable → Application
5. **Identity pressure**: Executive/leader self-concept invoked
6. **Unresolved exit**: Question that keeps processing

---

### Foundation 5: The Workflow Tool

> *Source: [k2m_workflow_tool.jsx](../k2m-refined-prompts/k2m_workflow_tool.jsx)*

A React component exists for workflow visualization with phase tracking. Key features:
- Step-by-step wizard interface
- Phase navigation (Analyst → Architect → Copywriter → Editor)
- Input fields for each checkpoint
- Progress tracking

**The Four Voice/Tone Options** (defined in `toneOptions`):

| ID | Label | Description | Best For |
|----|-------|-------------|----------|
| `philosophical` | Philosophical & Contemplative | Deep, reflective, builds slowly | Essays, meditative topics |
| `direct` | Direct & Confrontational | Bold claims, challenges reader | Wake-up calls, urgent shifts |
| `warm` | Warm but Challenging | Empathetic tone, still pushes | Personal development, sensitive topics |
| `systemic` | Cold & Inevitable | Systems view, matter-of-fact | **K2M default** — executives, systems thinkers |

These map to the Copywriter's voice calibration checklist and pair naturally with juggling patterns:
- **Systemic Trap** pattern → **Cold & Inevitable** tone
- **Soft Infiltration** → **Philosophical & Contemplative**
- **Identity First** → **Warm but Challenging**

This provides a reference implementation for a future UI, though the BMAD module will be CLI/agent-first.

## The Gap: What's Missing

From the conversation with Rabbit, the actual workflow is:

```
INTUITION SPARK ("I see a connection between X and Y")
    ↓
Haphazard prompt → ChatGPT/Claude → Deep research output
    ↓
Upload to NotebookLM (+ native sources)
    ↓
Generate FIRST audio → Listen → Let it BOIL 🧠
    ↓
Compounding happens (connections deepen in memory)
    ↓
Ask NotebookLM: "What themes/examples can be written?"
    ↓
Generate SECOND podcast (focused)
    ↓
Transcribe → Run through K2M workflow
    ↓
[LOOP STAYS OPEN] ← New insight? Return anytime.
```

**What works well:**
- Memory IS the capture system—insights compound through reflection, not apps
- NotebookLM confirms and surfaces what's already sensed intuitively
- The "boiling" phase is sacred—where intuition compounds
- The loop never truly closes—insights can return you to any point

**The actual gaps:**
1. **Before writing**: No structured way to inject "emphasize THIS angle" before K2M runs
2. **After publishing**: No structured way to return to a notebook, go deeper, or cross-pollinate with other nodes
3. **The 4 agents exist as documents**, not as invocable BMAD agents

---

## Proposed Solution: Three-Layer Architecture

### LAYER 1: Knowledge Nodes (NotebookLM Notebooks)

Notebooks aren't projects that close. They're **living knowledge nodes** you orbit:

```
      Notebook A (Consciousness)
           ↑↓
You ←→ Notebook B (Systems Thinking) ←→ Future Newsletter
           ↑↓
      Notebook C (Identity)
           ↑↓
         (new connections emerge)
```

**Node Registry** — Simple tracking:
- What notebooks exist (themes)
- What's been extracted from them (newsletters)
- Connections between nodes you've noticed
- Last visited, status (active/dormant/extracted)

---

### LAYER 2: Transformation Engine (Already Built)

Convert existing agent prompts to BMAD-style agents:

| Agent | Source Document | Key Checkpoint |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Analyst** | [analyst_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/analyst_agent.md) | Checkpoint 1: YOUR thesis, resonance, audience, angle |
| **Architect** | [architect_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/architect_agent.md) | Checkpoint 2: Structure approval, pattern fit, title preference |
| **Copywriter** | [copywriter_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/copywriter_agent.md) | (Optional section review) |
| **Editor** | [editor_agent.md](../k2m-refined-prompts/editor_agent.md) | Checkpoint 4: Final approval, litmus test validation |
| **Visual Strategist** | (to be created) | (Optional, no checkpoint) |

**Agent Knowledge Base Requirements:**

Each agent needs access to specific craft knowledge beyond their role prompt. As you learn new techniques, you update the knowledge base—and ALL agents benefit on their next run.

| Agent | Required Knowledge | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| **Analyst** | ACM framework, juggling patterns | To do preliminary module mapping and rank by destabilization potential |
| **Architect** | Pattern selection logic, tone-pattern pairings | To select pattern, map modules, match tone to audience |
| **Copywriter** | Module execution tactics, voice constants, successful examples | To execute each module correctly, avoid pitfalls, match voice |
| **Editor** | Non-negotiables, litmus test, module warnings | To check if modules pass, catch drift, validate quality gates |

---

### LAYER 3: Bridging Workflows (The Missing Piece)

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Inject** | "Before I run K2M..." | Add your angle/emphasis, what to pronounce, your thesis |
| **Transform** | "Run the full pipeline" | Analyst → Architect → Copywriter → Editor with checkpoints |
| **Return** | "I want to go deeper on X" | Re-enter a node, add insights, cross-link to other nodes |

```

**Knowledge Base Design Principle:**

> The knowledge compounds across agents. When you learn a better way to execute Module 3 (Pressure), you update `module-execution.md` once—and the Copywriter, Editor, and Architect all benefit on their next run. Your craft knowledge grows in one place.
