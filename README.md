# Conscious-Founder BMAD Module

**Preserve creative essence while gaining BMAD structure**

A BMAD module that wraps Rabbit's K2M (Knowledge to Mind) newsletter workflow — converting standalone AI agent prompts into BMAD-compliant agents with **zero semantic loss**.

---

## 🌟 What This Does

- ✅ **Wraps 4 K2M agents** (Analyst, Architect, Copywriter, Editor) in BMAD format with zero behavioral drift
- ✅ **Orchestrates 4 workflows** (Inject, Transform, Return, Repurpose) with human-judgment checkpoints
- ✅ **Implements Altitude Engine** — creative cartography showing patterns across your entire body of work
- ✅ **Preserves framework essence** — every nuance of ACM framework, juggling patterns, voice constants maintained
- ✅ **Reference implementation** — template for other creators to wrap their agent systems

---

## 🎯 Features

### Core Agents

1. **Alex (Analyst)** - Extract insights from transcripts without making strategic decisions
2. **Sam (Architect)** - Structure content using ACM framework and pattern selection
3. **Casey (Copywriter)** - Generate content with calibrated voice
4. **Eve (Editor)** - Review content against quality gates and ACM litmus test

### Structured Workflows

1. **Inject** - Capture emphasis/angle before boiling phase completes (< 30 seconds)
2. **Transform** - Execute full K2M pipeline with 4 human-judgment checkpoints
3. **Return** - Re-enter published nodes with full context for deepening insights
4. **Repurpose** - Generate Type A/B/C social posts using ACM framework

### Knowledge Base

- ACM Framework (7 modules, 3 non-negotiables, litmus test)
- Juggling Patterns (5 patterns with psychological descriptions)
- Voice Constants and Quality Gates
- Pattern Selection and Checkpoint Philosophy

## 🚀 Usage

### Invoke Agents

```bash
/bmad:k2m-analyst      # Start Alex (Analyst)
/bmad:k2m-architect    # Start Sam (Architect)
/bmad:k2m-copywriter   # Start Casey (Copywriter)
/bmad:k2m-editor       # Start Eve (Editor)
```

### Run Workflows

```bash
/bmad:conscious-founder:inject      # Capture emphasis
/bmad:conscious-founder:transform   # Run full pipeline
/bmad:conscious-founder:return      # Re-enter published nodes
/bmad:conscious-founder:repurpose   # Generate social posts
```

### Example: Complete K2M Pipeline

```bash
# Step 1: Capture your emphasis (before boiling phase completes)
/bmad:conscious-founder:inject

# Step 2: Run the full pipeline
/bmad:k2m-analyst
# → Select [AN] to analyze transcript
# → Provide thesis at Checkpoint 1

/bmad:k2m-architect
# → Select [AS] to structure content
# → Approve pattern at Checkpoint 2

/bmad:k2m-copywriter
# → Select [CW] to write draft

/bmad:k2m-editor
# → Select [ED] to review and finalize
# → Approve at Checkpoint 4

# Step 3: After publishing, re-enter to deepen
/bmad:conscious-founder:return

# Step 4: Generate social posts
/bmad:conscious-founder:repurpose
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Agent Invocation

```bash
/bmad:k2m-analyst
# When Alex loads, select [CH] to chat
# Ask: "Hello! Can you tell me what you do?"
```

### Test Full Workflow

1. Prepare a transcript
2. Run Inject workflow to capture emphasis
3. Run Transform workflow (all 4 agents)
4. Review outputs in `_bmad-output/conscious-founder/`

## 🎨 Key Innovations

### 1. Essence Preservation Pattern
- **Zero semantic loss conversion** - Every prompt nuance preserved verbatim
- **Side-by-side verification** - Test that BMAD agents = standalone agents
- **Knowledge base as single-source-of-truth** - Prevents framework divergence

### 2. Creative Cartography (Altitude Engine)
- **Semantic similarity detection** across all published nodes
- **Territory reports** after each publish
- **Pattern recognition** across body of work
- **Evolution mapping** showing thinking phases over time

### 3. Atelier Collaboration Model
- **"Yes, and" collaboration** - Agents build on ideas, don't replace them
- **Checkpoint philosophy** - Human judgment at critical decision points
- **Flow state preservation** - Structure AROUND creative process, not replacing it
