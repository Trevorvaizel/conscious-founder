      # Inject Workflow - Capture Your Creative Emphasis

      Before the boiling phase completes, capture the specific angle, emphasis, or connection you want to pronounce.

      ## What to Capture
      - What's YOUR thesis from this content?
      - What insight do YOU want to emphasize?
      - What's your angle/connection to this?

      ## Why Capture Now?
      If you don't capture this NOW, before the boiling phase completes, you'll lose 80% of the nuance.

      ## Your Emphasis
      Type your emphasis below (be as specific as possible):

    # Output storage
    output:
      type: file
      path: "{output}/emphasis/{timestamp}-emphasis.md"
      format: markdown

    # Templates
    templates:
      output: |
        # Creative Emphasis Capture
        **Date:** {date}
        **Time:** {time}
        **Transcript:** {transcript_source}

        ## Your Emphasis
        {user_input}

        ## Context Notes
        - Captured before boiling phase completion
        - Will flow into Transform workflow
        - Timestamp: {timestamp}

  - id: inject_02
    name: Save Emphasis
    description: Save emphasis to file for later use
    type: system
    handler: save_file

    output:
      type: file
      path: "{output}/emphasis/{timestamp}-emphasis.md"
      overwrite: false

    completion:
      message: |
        ✓ Emphasis captured successfully!

        Your emphasis has been saved and will flow into the Transform workflow when you're ready.

        **Next steps:**
        1. Let the boiling phase complete
        2. Run: /bmad:conscious-founder:transform
        3. Your emphasis will be automatically loaded

# Workflow completion
